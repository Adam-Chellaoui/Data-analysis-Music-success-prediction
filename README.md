## 1. Context of the Project

Congratulations! You have just been hired as a data scientist at Piccardi Music, a promising new music label created by a mysterious Italian disc jockey "Signor Piccardi". The company hired you to carry out a variety of data-related tasks, which will be explained in further detail below.

For this homework you will use a dataset of 18,403 music reviews scraped from Pitchfork, including relevant metadata such as review author, review date, record release year, review score, and genre, along with the respective album's audio features pulled from Spotify's API.

We study two questions : 
* Will this album be a hit ?
* Is the Second Album Syndrome real ?
